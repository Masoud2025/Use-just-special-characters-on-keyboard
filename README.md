# How to Install AutoHotkey

Before you can use cool AHK scripts or make your own, you'll need to install AutoHotkey on your system.

Visit [AutoHotkey's homepage](https://www.autohotkey.com/), click Download, and **choose Download Current Version** to grab it. Run through the quick install dialog, and you're ready to start using AutoHotkey scripts.

## How to Create New AutoHotkey Scripts

The program you just installed handles the execution of AHK scripts, but it won't do anything until you actually have a script running.

To create a new AutoHotkey script, right-click anywhere on your desktop (or wherever else is convenient) and choose New > AutoHotkey Script. Name it something that makes sense. Then right-click on your new file and choose Edit Script, or open the file in your text editor of choice, to start working on it.

>Note that you can also open your text editor, type up an AutoHotkey script, and save it as a file ending in .ahk to achieve the same result. Just make sure it has the right file extension!

## Run Script

To run a script, simply double-click on it and it will go into effect. However, **you'll probably want some of these scripts to run as soon as you boot your computer so you don't have to start them manually every time.**
To do so, copy and paste the .ahk files into your Startup folder. You can get there easily by typing shell: startup into the Start menu. Otherwise, browse to the following location:

>@C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
